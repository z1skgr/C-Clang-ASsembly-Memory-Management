# Digital Computers
 C,Clang,Assembly

# 1
Linking C to behavior in specific material. Familiarity with the hexadeced representation. The project is specified for ordering elements in memory using pointers and arrays. 
# 2
Familiarity with data management in memory and CLang language. A program is created for implementing a linked list of elements. An element contains two values (id,value). The program has a menu for insert/delete/search print operations in list. The program is implemented in C and Clang.
# 3
Deepening the understanding of memory function in Clang and early understanding of Assembly. The program is an extension of its previous version. Its functionality is extended with function pointers. The programs is created in C,Clang and some functionalities are created in Assembly
# 4
Deepening the understanding of Assembly
# 5
Create recursive functions by using a data in Assembly
# 6
Management of SPIM input/output devices, using the memory display of the units I/O, and using polling and using interrupts

# How to Run
Every project is run in appropriate platform (Devc++ for c,clang, Qspim for Assembly)
